# Loaderr

## What is Loaderr?
Loaderr is small piece of script, aimed to help in the task of loading and injection of external snippets (or components) and the needed dependencies in a static page with only one simple script call.

It can load **JS scripts** and **CSS styles** with ease.

## Motivation:

Loaderr was created to supply the need of injecting dynamic content in an environment where the pages are static and generated by a CMS in which we have no control.

## How it works:

Loaderr receives an array of JS/CSS and loads them synchronously. The JS loader accepts conditionals to determine if a module should be loaded or not.

## How to use:

To use Loaderr, just include the _loaderr.js_ script and then add a _&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="yourmodule.js" /&gt;_ in your page.

### The modules format:

A module is a simple javascript file that tells Loaderr what files to load, in which order and under which condition.

### Example:
```
    var styles = [
        "/static/css/my_snipet/main.css" ,
        "/static/css/dist/some_lib/some_lib_style.css"
    ],
    
    scripts = [
        ["/static/js/dist/jquery-1.10.2.min.js", !window.jQuery ],
        ["/static/js/dist/underscore-1.5.1.min.js", !window._ ],
         "/static/js/dist/some_mobile_detection_lib_or_routine.js", /* no condition, it is always loaded */
        ["/static/js/my_libs/my_utils.js", !window.myUtils ],
         "/static/js/my_snipet/main.js", /* no condition, it is always loaded */
        [ "/static/js/my_snipet/mobile_specific.js", window.isMobile ], /* loads only if mobile */
    ];
    
    loaderr.loadStyles(styles, function() {
        /* loadStyles callback */
    
        loaderr.loadScripts(scripts, function(){
            /* loadScripts callback */
            
            /* at this point all dependecies are already loaded and you can safely start your application */
            mySnippet.init(); 
        });
    });
```
